export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am an enthusiastic aspiring full stack developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. I have hands-on experience with React.js for building dynamic user interfaces, Spring Boot for creating robust back-end services, MongoDB for flexible data storage, and Django for rapid web application development. I'm eager to apply my skills and learn new technologies to contribute to innovative projects and grow as a developer.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am an enthusiastic aspiring developer with a strong passion for Python and web technologies. My journey in programming began with Python, and I've fallen in love with its versatility and elegance. This passion has led me to explore web development, where I'm eager to grow and learn more every day.

I've been working on projects using Django, Python's powerful web framework, to build web applications. Additionally, I've dipped my toes into front-end development with React, backend services with Spring Boot, and database management with MongoDB. While I'm still at the beginning of my journey, I'm excited about the endless possibilities these technologies offer.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and am always looking for new challenges to expand my skills. I enjoy collaborating with others, solving problems, and contributing to projects that can make a difference. Outside of coding, I spend time reading tech blogs, participating in coding challenges, and exploring new libraries and frameworks.

My goal is to grow into a well-rounded full stack developer, and I'm committed to putting in the hard work to get there. I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute my current skills while learning from more experienced developers and taking on new challenges.`;
